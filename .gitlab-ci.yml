# This pipeline requires the following variables:
#
# VERCEL_ORG_ID
# VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
# VERCEL_TOKEN
#
# These should be masked (mainly VERCEL_TOKEN). If you would like
# preview deployments for every branch, then these variables should be
# unprotected, but make sure you read the footer on pipeline security!
#
# See https://vercel.com/guides/using-vercel-cli-for-custom-workflows
# for a guide on how to get these variables.

# At a high level, this pipeline consists of three stages:
#
# 1. A testing stage that builds the project, checks it for type errors,
#    lints it for style errors, and runs unit tests.
#
# 2. A preview deployment stage that creates a preview database for that
#    branch if it doesn't exist already, performs any migrations, seeds
#    it, and initiates a preview deployment to Vercel.
#
# 3. A production deployment stage that performs any migrations on the
#    production database, initiates a production deployment to Vercel
#    and aliases the deployment to the production URL.
#
# There is also a job that cleans up the corresponding preview database
# when a branch is deleted.
#
# Wherever possible, Vercel (not GitLab's CI/CD variables settings) is
# used as the single source of truth for environment variables in order
# to minimize configuration drift.
#
# Therefore, environment variables like the database connection string
# are declared in Rodeo's Vercel project settings, which can then be
# downloaded from the command line with the first call to `vercel pull`.

# IMPORTANT: since Vercel does not support scoping personal access
# tokens, all stages share the same $VERCEL_TOKEN so that we can get a
# preview deployment for every branch. Therefore, you MUST configure
# GitLab to always only use the .gitlab-ci.yml from your master branch
# through Settings > CI/CD > General pipelines > CI/CD configuration
# with the value
#
# .gitlab-ci.yml@USERNAME_OR_GROUP_NAMESPACE/REPOSITORY_NAME:BRANCH
#
# For example, we use .gitlab-ci.yml@freetail-hackers/rodeo:master. In
# addition, you MUST rigorously review any merge requests that change
# the pipeline. That way, non-maintainers cannot expose the Vercel token
# and deploy to production without permission.

default:
  # This pipeline requires a custom Docker image with npm and psql
  # installed (see the relevant Dockerfile for details)
