/**
 * Here is an overview of Rodeo's OAuth architecture:
 *
 * 1. The user clicks the "Sign in with ..." button on the login page.
 * 2. That button links to a route like /login/oauth?provider=... which
 *    corresponds to the GET function below.
 * 3. The GET function selects the correct provider depending on the
 *    provider query parameter and redirects the user to the provider's
 *    consent screen (after setting a cookie with a random state to
 *    prevent CSRF).
 * 4. The user consents to the permissions requested by Rodeo (currently
 *    just their email address) and is redirected back to the
 *    /login/oauth/[provider] route, which corresponds to the GET
 *    function in the provider's +server.ts file.
 * 5. That GET function validates the state and callback and extracts
 *    the user's email from the provider's API if necessary (how this is
 *    done depends on the provider), making sure that the email is
 *    verified as well. This is required because every account must have
 *    an email associated with it for receiving communications.
 * 6. The GET function then calls the _upsert function below to create
 *    or link accounts as needed, sets up a session, and redirects the
 *    user to the home page.
